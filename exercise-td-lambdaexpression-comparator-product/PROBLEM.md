## Problem Statement: Understanding Lambda Expression,Comparator and Method Reference ##

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem, Product model has the following properties
         
            product id
            category (like 'clothing','toys')
            product name
            product price
            
- Following functionality has to be implemented
         
            - Should sort the products by product name lexically
            - Should sort the products by length of product name.If lengths are same, sorted by product name lexically
            - Should sort the products by price in descending order
            - Should sort the products by category in ascending order then by price in descending order 
          
        
## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
