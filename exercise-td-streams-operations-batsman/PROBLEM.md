## Problem Statement: Stream operations and collectors

This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique

  - Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
  - Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
  - Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass 
  - Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below
  
  ```
   In this problem, cricket batsman data has to searched, analyzed and extracted from given input collections, based on the criteria given below 
        
   - Following functionality needs to be implemented
   
        - Search the batsman with the given name and country code
        - Provide the sorted batsman names in a string for the given country code, as per expected format in provided test
        - Provide player names and total runs Scored as a pair, for players who have played more than 50 matches
        - Provide the highest runs scored by batsman for a given country name
        - Provide a list of player names for a given country who have scored more than 5000 runs, in descending order        
  ```   

   **NOTE: ALL THE METHODS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED USING STREAMS API ONLY**
         
## Instructions
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
