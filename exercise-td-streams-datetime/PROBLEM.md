## Problem Statement: Understanding ArrayList and its methods ##

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem,LocalDate and LocalTime functions are applied along with streams
        
        - Method should return a List of String containing the working days for the next month given todays date.
           - Saturday and Sunday should be considered non working days
           - The date returned should be in format yyyy-MM-dd
   
        -Method should return a List of String containing the bus departure timings for a day given the start time and duration as parameters.
           - The timing in the list should be in 24 hour format HH:mm:ss

## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
