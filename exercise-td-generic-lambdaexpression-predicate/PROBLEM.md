## Problem Statement: Books has to be searched from the given list of books 

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem, books has to be searched from the given list of books 

      - Should return a matching book list given a list of books and a search string
      - Should return a matching book list given a list of books and a Predicate
      
**Note: use  lambda expression, predicate functional interface, streams API, collectors and generics**  
   
## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
